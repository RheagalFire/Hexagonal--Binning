### Hexagonal-Binning
Hexagonal Binning is a way to manage problem of having too many points that it starts to overlap. 

### Advantages
- Hexagons are more similar to circle than square, this translates in more efficient data aggregation around the bin center.
- The reason for using hexagons is that it is still pretty simple, and when you rotate the chart by 60 degrees (or a multiple of 60 degrees) you still get the same visualization.
- Can be used for nearest neighbour clustering or density estimation.
- 13% more packing space than square binning. 
- Examples:- Locations of Banks, Health Facilities,etc
